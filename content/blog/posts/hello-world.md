Welcome to my new cyber blog and portfolio site! This is where I'll be documenting my technical adventures, weekend projects, and deep dives into interesting technologies.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is organized into two main sections:

**Blog**: Casual documentation of weekend projects, technical experiments, and explorations. These posts capture the real journey of discovery - including the missteps, breakthroughs, and everything in between.

**Portfolio**: More formal documentation of significant projects and research work. These represent comprehensive, structured analysis of complex technical implementations.

## The Journey Begins

I'm excited to start sharing what I learn as I dive into new technologies, build interesting projects, and explore the fascinating world of software development. Whether you're here for the technical details or just curious about the process of discovery, I hope you find something useful or interesting.

Stay tuned for the first real deep dive - coming soon!
