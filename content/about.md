# About Lukas May

Welcome to my cybersecurity blog and portfolio! I'm a Junior at the Rochester Insitute of Technology (RIT) studying cybersecurity who loves diving deep into interesting technical problems and sharing what I learn along the way. A big part of my focus is OT security--how we defend critical infrastructure like the electric grid, water treatment plants, or manufacturing systems. Through this blog I aim to share my research and analysis of the cybersecurity and tech world.

## What You'll Find Here
This site serves two main purposes:
- **Blog**: Casual documentation of my weekend projects, technical experiments, and deep dives into topics that catch my interest.
- **Portfolio**: More formal documentation of significant projects. These represent structured, comprehensive analysis of complex technical implementations.

## Get In Touch

*Thanks for stopping by! Whether you're here for the casual weekend project stories or the more formal technical documentation, I hope you find something useful or interesting.*
