# About Lukas May

Welcome to my tech blog and portfolio! I'm a developer and researcher who loves diving deep into interesting technical problems and sharing what I learn along the way.

## What You'll Find Here

This site serves two main purposes:

**Blog**: Casual documentation of my weekend projects, technical experiments, and deep dives into topics that catch my interest. These posts capture the authentic journey of exploration - including the dead ends, breakthrough moments, and everything in between.

**Portfolio**: More formal documentation of significant projects, research work, and professional technical achievements. These represent structured, comprehensive analysis of complex technical implementations.

## Background

*[This section is ready for you to customize with your specific background, expertise, and interests]*

## Get In Touch

The best way to reach me is through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasmay/), where I'm always happy to connect with fellow developers, researchers, and anyone interested in technical discussions.

*Thanks for stopping by! Whether you're here for the casual weekend project stories or the more formal technical documentation, I hope you find something useful or interesting.*
